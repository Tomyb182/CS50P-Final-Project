    #### Description: Football League Insights is a Python program made by a football fan for football fans. It allows the user to enter the name of a football league and a season to see the final position of every team in that league for that specific year. The user is also able to get the table of the top 20 goal scorers in the specified league and year.

# Prerequisites
To use this program, you need all the dependencies shown on the requirements.txt file. In the script you are going to find the api-football API key. Make sure you have it before starting.

# How to use it
After you've ensured that all prerequisites are met, follow these steps to use the program:

Run the Program: Execute the script, and it will prompt you to enter the league you want to explore. You can choose from among nine of the most popular football leagues, including:
    Premier League (England)
    La Liga (Spain)
    Eredivisie (Netherlands)
    Serie A (Italy)
    Ligue 1 (France)
    Bundesliga (Germany)
    MLS (United States)
    Brasileir√£o (Brazil)

Select the Season: After you've selected the league, the program will ask you for the season (the year). Enter the desired year to retrieve the standings and top scorers for that season.

View Standings: The program will display the final standings for the selected league and season, including information like team rank, points, goals scored and conceded, goal difference, and more.

Check Top Scorers: After viewing the standings, you'll be asked if you want to see the top goal scorers. If you respond 'yes', the program will display a list of the top goal scorers for the selected league and season, along with their respective teams and goal counts.

# Additional Features
Champion Indication: If a team is the champion of the league, the program will indicate it with a special message.

User-Friendly Output: The program's output is formatted for readability, with clear separators and headings
to help users understand the data.

Interactive Prompts: The program allows for user interaction, with prompts for league selection, season selection, and the option to view top scorers.
